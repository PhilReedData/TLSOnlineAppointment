# Help using online appointments

If you have an enquiry with a member of library staff from the Teaching, Learning and Students teams, 
they may offer you an online appointment. 
The appointment will allow both you and the member of library staff, to share screens, and communicate via audio or video.

## What should I do before the online appointment?

You will need to [install Zoom software](https://zoom.us/support/download) before the appointment. 
It is available for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android. 
The Windows version will work even if you do not have administrator rights. 
Any modern PC should work; please refer to  
[Zoom system requirements](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362023-System-Requirements-for-PC-Mac-and-Linux) 
for more details. 
The following guide applies to the Windows PC version.

It is possible to have an online appointment without installing the Zoom software beforehand. 
You will be offered to download the Zoom installer at the start of the appointment.

We recommend that you use headphones and a microphone on your PC or laptop. 
This will help you to hear clearly without producing audio feedback.

Please take care not to share any sensitive or private data with us,
be aware of what applications you have open such as email or un-anonymised patient data. 
We suggest you make a backup of any document that we may be working on with you before the appointment.
