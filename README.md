# TLS online appointment access
Wrapper for LibChat for students to connect to online appointments

This html page (or set of html and css files) will be a wrapper for a LibChat widget. This widget is used for appointments with Teaching, Learning and Students teams so that they can start a screensharing session without interrupting the general LibChat queue. It will live on a University server. It will look a bit like a Library webpage with the proper logo, header and footer, as much as necessary. The link will only be given out when an appointment has been made.

## View the site
* [Dev site](https://philreeddata.github.io/tls-chat/): live render directly from this repository

## Instructions for editing
* The main index page can be copied straight over.
* The docs page is generated by Jekyll, so you can write the content in Markdown and the wrapper in HTML.
  * Open the docs file in the browser
  * Save it as html
  * Replace all the image references with `images/`, except the logo which is on the UoM server
  * Replace the link at the bottom from github to `../`
  * Rename it `docs/index.html` then copy it over
