# TLS online appointment access
Wrapper for LibChat for students to connect to online appointments

This html page (or set of html and css files) will be a wrapper for a LibChat widget. This widget is used for appointments with Teaching, Learning and Students teams so that they can start a screensharing session without interrupting the general LibChat queue. It will live on a University server. It will look a bit like a Library webpage with the proper logo, header and footer, as much as necessary. The link will only be given out when an appointment has been made.
